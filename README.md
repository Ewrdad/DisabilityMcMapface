# Help Me Out

An app to help people get out of the house and where they want, regardless of ability, need or personal difficulties

## Origins

Originated at NHS hackday 2025 - Cardiff, where it won the judges vote and a second place amongst the community. Although winning matters much less than the countless amount of support and passionate people coming together believing in a better world for people with access needs. Did enjoy the tshirt.

## How can I help?

We are currently working on finalising our setup but if you're interested you can help us in many ways

### What we need

Developers, disabled people, able people, physical therapists, people with a beating heart and most importantly people who want to make a difference.

### What can I do now?

If you're stuck you can help by looking at our Kanban board
